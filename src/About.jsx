              My journey in coding began in elementary school where I created
              VBS scripts to do various tasks with my computer (such as opening
              the CD drive)â€”igniting a passion that has stayed with me
              throughout my career. I realized my heart is in software
              engineering. I noticed the tasks I enjoyed the most involved
              tinkering and playing with cool applications with little
              oversight. In my previous career, I leveraged cutting-edge cools
              such as PowerAutomate and UI Path: tools which my higher-ups had
              little experience with. Recently, I've been given the opportunity
              to work on various projects which have me hone my craft as a
              software engineer.
